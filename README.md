# EfficientFrontierVarCVar

## Project Description
In this project we are gonna implement an Efficient Frontier and a Value at Risk (VaR) & Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) calculator.

We are gonna present three strategies to calculate VaR and CVaR: the first one uses historical data, the second one is a parametrical version and the third one uses Monte-Carlo simulation.

Finally, we will implement the Efficient Frontier calculator that gives the Max Sharpe Ratio and Min Volatility portfolio of given assets.

## How to use the calculator 

1. Go to Example section of each calculator
2. Choose your favorite stocks. (Remember to use Yahoo Finance tickers)
3. Obtain your results

# EfficientFrontierVarCVar

## Project Description
In this project we are gonna implement an Efficient Frontier and a Value at Risk (VaR) & Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) calculator.

We are gonna present three strategies to calculate VaR and CVaR: the first one uses historical data, the second one is a parametrical version and the third one uses Monte-Carlo simulation.

Finally, we will implement the Efficient Frontier calculator that gives the Max Sharpe Ratio and Min Volatility portfolio of given assets.
